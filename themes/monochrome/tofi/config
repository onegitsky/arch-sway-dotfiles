### Window positioning

	# Set the size of the exclusive zone.

	# A value of -1 means ignore exclusive zones completely.
	# A value of 0 will move tofi out of the way of other windows' zones.

	# Values greater than 0 are only meaningful when tofi is anchored to a

### Behaviour

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# In drun mode, this is always true.

	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.

	# If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
	# anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.

### Inclusion
